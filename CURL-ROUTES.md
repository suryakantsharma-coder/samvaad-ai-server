## User Roles (RBAC)

All roles used in the system (exact strings):

| Role             | String value    |
|------------------|-----------------|
| User             | `user`          |
| Doctor           | `doctor`        |
| Moderator        | `moderator`     |
| Hospital Admin   | `hospital_admin`|
| Admin            | `admin`         |

**Per-role behavior:**

- **user**
  - Can login and register (role defaults to `user` if omitted).
  - No hospital linked.
  - No access to admin, hospitals, doctors, patients, or appointments; only protected auth routes (e.g. `/auth/me`, `/auth/logout-all`).

- **doctor**
  - Can login and register only with a valid `hospitalId` (required at signup).
  - Has hospital linked (`user.hospital` set).
  - Access: **Doctors (read-only):** GET /api/doctors, GET /api/doctors/search, GET /api/doctors/:id (hospital-scoped). **Patients:** list/get/update (hospital-scoped); cannot create/delete. **Appointments:** list/get/update (hospital-scoped); cannot create/delete. **Prescriptions:** list/search/get/create/update (hospital-scoped); cannot delete. No access to hospitals CRUD or admin users.

- **moderator**
  - Cannot self-register (403); must be created by an admin.
  - Must not have hospital linked (schema enforces null for admin/moderator).
  - **Not used by any route currently.** Role exists for future use; `requireModerator` middleware is available for moderator-level routes.

- **hospital_admin**
  - Can login and register only with a valid `hospitalId` (required at signup).
  - Has hospital linked.
  - Access: admin routes (list users scoped to their hospital). **Hospitals:** GET list (own only), GET by ID (own only), PATCH (own only). **Cannot create or delete hospitals** (admin only). Doctors/patients/appointments/prescriptions: full CRUD **scoped to their hospital**.

- **admin**
  - Cannot self-register (403); must be created by another admin.
  - Must not have hospital linked (schema enforces null for admin/moderator).
  - Access: all routes; only role that can **create** (POST) and **delete** (DELETE) hospitals. List all users, all hospitals; doctors/patients/appointments not filtered by hospital (sees all).

**Hospital roles (defined at sign-up):**  
The roles **doctor** and **hospital_admin** are *hospital roles*: they are linked to a single hospital at sign-up via `hospitalId`. That link defines their data scope: they **only ever see data from their linked hospital** (doctors, patients, appointments; hospital_admin also sees their one hospital and users in that hospital). They never see overall/global data. If a hospital role has no linked hospital, the API returns 403 on hospital-scoped routes. Register response for these roles includes `linkedHospital` and a message that they will only see data for that hospital.

**Hospital scoping (when user has `hospital`):**  
For doctors, patients, and appointments: LIST returns only that hospital’s data; GET BY ID returns 403/404 if the resource belongs to another hospital; CREATE uses `req.user.hospital` (body `hospital` ignored); UPDATE/DELETE only on resources belonging to the user’s hospital.

## Public

### Health check

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/health"
```

### Register

- **Roles:** Anyone can register. `role` is optional; one of: `user`, `doctor`, `hospital_admin`. Defaults to `user`. **Admin and moderator cannot self-register** (403); they must be created by an existing admin.
- **Hospital roles (doctor, hospital_admin):** These roles are **defined at sign-up** by providing **`hospitalId`** or **`hospital`** (required). You can send either `hospitalId` (string) or `hospital` (string id or object with `_id`). The user is linked to that hospital and will **only see data from that hospital**—never overall data. The API enforces this on all hospital-scoped routes. Response includes `linkedHospital` (the hospital document) and a message that the user will only see data for this hospital. The value must be a valid MongoDB ObjectId and the hospital must exist in the DB. Role `user` should not send hospital.

```bash
# Basic user (no hospital)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"secret123","name":"Demo User","role":"user"}'

# Hospital admin (requires hospitalId – create hospital first via POST /api/hospitals)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@hospital.com","password":"secret123","name":"Hospital Admin","role":"hospital_admin","hospitalId":"HOSPITAL_OBJECT_ID"}'

# Doctor (requires hospitalId)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"doc@hospital.com","password":"secret123","name":"Dr. Smith","role":"doctor","hospitalId":"HOSPITAL_OBJECT_ID"}'
```

### Login

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"secret123"}'
```

Use `accessToken` and `refreshToken` from the response for protected and refresh calls.

### Refresh tokens

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/refresh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"refreshToken":"YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"}'
```

### Logout

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/logout" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"refreshToken":"YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"}'
```

---

## Protected (Bearer token required)

**Roles:** Any authenticated user (any role). Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the `accessToken` from login or refresh.

### Get current user

Returns `user` and `hospital`. If the user is linked to a hospital (`user.hospital` set), `hospital` is the hospital document or `null` if the hospital was deleted. If the user has no hospital, `hospital` is `null`. Does not crash on invalid/deleted hospital.

**Roles:** Any authenticated user.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Logout all devices

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/logout-all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

---

## Admin only (admin or hospital_admin role required)

All routes require `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

### List all users (filter by hospital)

**Roles:** admin, hospital_admin.

- **admin:** returns all users; optional query `hospitalId` filters users by that hospital.
- **hospital_admin:** returns only users belonging to their linked hospital (query `hospitalId` is ignored; they only see their hospital’s users).

```bash
# All users (admin: all; hospital_admin: their hospital only)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Filter by hospital (admin only; use for UI dropdown)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users?hospitalId=HOSPITAL_OBJECT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Assign role to existing user (hospital_admin only)

**Roles:** **hospital_admin only.** Admin cannot change user roles; only hospital admins can.

- **hospital_admin:** can assign roles only to users in their linked hospital. When setting `doctor` or `hospital_admin`, `hospitalId` must be their linked hospital. Cannot modify admin users.
- **admin:** returns 403 – only hospital admin can change user roles.

Body: `role` (required), `hospitalId` (optional; required when role is `doctor` or `hospital_admin`). Valid roles: `user`, `doctor`, `hospital_admin` (cannot assign `admin` or `moderator`).

```bash
curl -X PATCH "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users/USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"doctor","hospitalId":"HOSPITAL_OBJECT_ID"}'
```

---

## Hospitals

All hospital routes require `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

- **admin:** Only role that can **create** (POST) and **delete** (DELETE) hospitals. Can list all hospitals, get/update any hospital.
- **hospital_admin:** Can **only** list/get/update **their assigned hospital** (403 for any other ID). **Cannot create or delete hospitals.**

Create a hospital first (as **admin** via POST /api/hospitals), then use its `_id` as `hospitalId` when registering hospital_admin or doctor users.

### List hospitals (paginated)

**URL:** `GET /api/hospitals?page=1&limit=20`

- **admin:** Returns all hospitals.
- **hospital_admin:** Returns only the one hospital they are linked to.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/hospitals?page=1&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Get hospital by ID

- **admin:** Can get any hospital by ID.
- **hospital_admin:** Can only get their own hospital (403 if they request another hospital’s ID).

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/hospitals/HOSPITAL_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Create hospital (admin only)

**Roles:** **admin only.** hospital_admin cannot create hospitals.

You can send either **JSON** or **multipart/form-data** (to upload a logo).
